                                        In this project I used Open Data available from Google's BigQuery Public Database to create a Postgres Database. The goal was to link the datasets by Country which would make for quick analyses. The datasets were quite dense which became an issue for
                                        simple relational indices to be created, this led me to realize I was on the path to building a data lake, which was out of scope. This project consists mainly of Jupyter notebooks with a Postgres Database.

                                        This project started with a large historical database composed of National Wildfire records collected between 1992 and 2015, totaling <strong>1.88
                                    Million
                                    Wildfire incidents</strong>. MongoDB was the chosen database for the project because of the speed and simplicity of use. After loading the data into the database, a Flask server app was created to allow interactive
                                        access to the data via the dashboard. The dashboard consisted of various charts produced with Highcharts.js using JavaScript calls to the API serving the MongoDB data.

                                        This map shows the weekly Earthquakes recorded by the United States Geological Society. The data is real-time and updated every minute. from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. I used the Leaflet.js package to build the map and place the markers. I decided
                                        to use <em>Exclamation
                                Triangles</em> from the FontAwesome 5 library. These markers were then color-coded based on the earthquake's magnitude.

                                        This project aims to predict local epidemics of dengue fever using environmental data collected by U.S. Federal Government agencies. Using historical data for San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru, predictions were generated with the machine learning
                                        tools Google TensorFlow and Facebook Prophet. Raw data is available at <a class="orange-text" href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/"

                                        Our goal was to predict the number of dengue cases each week in each location based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, and vegetation. Predictions were generated based on a dataset with weekly cases from 1991
                                        to 2007 for San Juan and 2001 to 2009 for Iquitos. Two prediction models were used. Facebook Prophet forecasts time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and
                                        daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. TensorFlow is a Deep Learning library developed by Google, we developed a simple Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model.

                                        As seen in both of the above graphs plotting the time series predictions over the training and testing true values, both of the machine learning models aren’t able to accurately predict large spikes in Dengue Fever. While neither of these models are perfectly
                                        tuned, fine tuning a machine learning model takes quite a bit of hypothesis testing and therefore time, there seems to be an obvious need to bring in more related data in order to identify potential causal factors
                                        for the big spikes in the number of infected individuals per week. Even though correlation coefficient isn’t a direct measurement of a feature variables impact on a target variables outcome, it still gives a good
                                        indication of features that can help a machine learning model predict more accurately. San Juan’s environmental data features have a correlation coefficient range of -0.12 to 0.19 with respect to the number of cases
                                        per week, and Iquitos’s range is -0.13 to 0.23. This shows a relationship between environmental factors and the number of Dengue cases per week exists, but none of the variables have an extremely strong proportional
                                        or inverse relationship to explain the large fluctuations in the trend.

                                        I created a web page, using basic Bootstrap 4, that displayed various data and information about the planet Mars, such as weather from tweets and satellite images. This data and information was scraped and mined from various sources on the internet. Python
                                        allowed me to quickly build a script to get the job done. I used the python packages Splinter and Beautiful Soup to access the webpages, then navigate them by clicking links and selecting HTML elements before extracting
                                        the HTML or image data I was going to use. This data was then injeted into the webpage I built using the Flask web development package to display this aggregate information in an easy to digest manner.
